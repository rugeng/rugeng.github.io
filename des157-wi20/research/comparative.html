        <h2>Behance</h2>

        <p>The research I did was for Behance website, I really like the navigation bar. It had a search bar that you can easily to search the information you need. And you could see there is message and email icon on the right corner, which you can check your messages and email pretty quick. But their create project is one of the difficulties things to use. At first, you click the navigation bar then click on create a project. Then when you click upload files, it shows you only could upload some certain types files, but there is no place show what kind?? And you can’t even upload a pdf? Which is the most common file. I tried upload a jpeg instead, after that is pretty forward, you just add your tags or names. I also tried to upload a mov/mp4, after I upload my video, I was trying to select a cover for my video, there is no option that you can use one of your frames as your cover. This is a very common website to publish your project, but it had so much difficulties going on. </p>
        <p>But it had some cool features that you can search jobs and post jobs, which makes it easier and convenience. And I also like they have different sections such as “For You”, “Discover”, and “Live” class to improve my skills.

        <h2>Instagram</h2>

        <p>In Instagram the most commonly utilized upload options are saved images, take a new photo, or select video.
        Once you have chosen any of these, the app will allow you to change the filter, cropping, and orientation.
        Advanced editing options are available for adjusting contrast, brightness, structure, warmth, saturation, vignetting, sharpness, tilt shift, etc.
        Instagram stories are a relatively new feature  with similar functionality to Snapchat. Individual stories expire within twenty-four hours, have filters and lenses, and text/personalization options.
        Some interactive features include polls, donation, comments, mentions, hashtags, music, quizzes, countowns, gifs, and stickers.
        This has afforded individuals and businesses the opportunity to share and promote content.

        For Instagram, if you want to update anything, you can just click the dots next to your post, the you can edit the tag, location, turn off comments or change your post to other apps. Same for videos.
        But you can’t edit your pictures. If you want to edit your pictures you have to post again. Which is so inconvenient.
