    <h1>What's going on with coronavirus??</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Home</a></P>
    <p>Coronavirus outbreaks are mainly used in cases where severe illness is documented, and case definitions used fail to capture patients with mild illness.
    Experts tell STAT that this approach is likely to lead to an underestimation of the total number of cases and false assumptions about mortality calculated for those who ignore repeated warnings (that is, mathematical calculations now).
    Experts soon noticed that the Chinese did not deliberately underreport cases. Instead, the method proved challenging to collect data in the early days of the epidemic. When tens of thousands of patients appear in hospitals seeking care, there is no time to find people with less symptoms and staying at home.
    "I think the situation in China is so chaotic at the moment, and it may be difficult to collect data on the entire disease lineup," said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.
    
    According to World Health Organization statistics, an official estimate in China is that 20% of cases are severely ill. However, the calculations are based on known cases and will not reflect minor, undiscovered cases.
    
    WHO Emergency Leader Mike Ryan told reporters on Wednesday that due to uncertainty about the severity of the disease and how easily the pathogens that cause it can spread, it is impossible to predict if the virus will continue to spread globally, What will happen.

    <P>The so-called R naught is about 2.2, which is a mathematical equation that shows how many people per infected person get sick.
    World health officials warn that as more cases of coronavirus are revealed, true zero results may take months.
    Chinese Minister of Health Ma Xiaowei recently told reporters that there is evidence that it has mutated into a more powerful mutation that can be spread more easily in humans.      
    Infectious disease experts and scientists say new coronaviruses that are closing companies in mainland China may be more contagious than current data show.
    
    About a month ago, the virus appeared in Wuhan, China. It has spread from 300 people on January 21 to nearly 21,000 people and killed more than 420 people, adding thousands of new cases every day.
    
    "The rapid increase in cases is worrying," Dr. Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the World Health Organization's emergency plan, said at a press conference last week.
    Chinese scientists worry that respiratory diseases have mutated to suit their new human hosts, and that respiratory diseases may be more rapid than fish infections. World health officials say respiratory diseases could come from fish markets. Data about the virus changes every day, and some infectious disease experts say it will take weeks to know how infectious it is. According to interviews with epidemiologists, scientists and infectious disease experts, what they have seen so far is worrying and has led U.S. and international scientists to believe that the virus is more contagious than current data suggests.

    The disease is spreading rapidly. Chinese Health Minister Ma Xiaowei told reporters last month that there is evidence that it has mutated into a stronger mutation that can spread more easily in humans. World health officials know that respiratory diseases can be spread through person-to-person contact, droplets carried by sneezing and coughing, and residual bacteria on inanimate objects. Health officials said the disease had spread before symptoms appeared, and about 20% of the patients were seriously ill, causing pneumonia and respiratory failure.</P>
